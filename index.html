            <h5 class="card-title">Pinakbet</h5>
            <p class="card-text">A Filipino-traditional vegetable dish saut√©ed with shrimp paste and garlic. This interesting and healthy dish is 
                best for the vegetarian with the combination of okra, eggplant, and squash. It's worth to try!

            <h5 class="card-title">Beef Kare-Kare</h5>
            <p class="card-text">My favorite Filipino food of all times! This interesting taste being a Filipino is one of a kind. Filipino 
                loves salty foods but this Kare-kare dish is different with the peanut sauce, and it doesn't have to be salty. However, 
                we ate this dish with rice and a shrimp paste in the side for balancing the saltiness.

            <h5 class="card-title">Paksiw</h5>
            <p class="card-text">A fish stew simmered in vinegar, garlic, black pepper, and specially ginger to make the taste stronger and to 
                achieve the fragrance. This traditional food recipe really love by the most Filipinos, aside from the delicious taste, it is also 
                practical to have this dish because it could last even outside the fridge. The longer you keep it, the more savory it gets!

            <h5 class="card-title">Dinuguan(Pork Blood Stew)</h5>
            <p class="card-text">It is sounds strange, right? But yes, we cook the pork blood with the pork intestine in it. We usually ate this dish 
                with rice but traditionally, this dish eaten by several Filipinos with the white bao-ban by dipping it in the blood stew. Sounds 
                really new? Worth to try!
